        Calculate the number corresponding to the permutation order from the Lehmer Code

        Any `n`-element set of distinguishable elements can be ordered in `n!` different ways (permutations). This
        procedure assigns a unique number to each permutation. For more details see:
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehmer_code

        The code of this procedure is based on the source of Permutation module: https://github.com/jwodder/permutation/
        This procedure was placed here to avoid references to this module, which makes it much easier to use this script
        on mobile devices, with Pythonista/iOS or Pydroid 3/Android. If you prefer to use Permutation module, remove
        this procedure and uncomment these lines:
# from permutation import Permutation
        and replace line
random_number = lehmer(dices_order)
        with line
# random_number = Permutation(*dices_order).lehmer(len(dices_order))


    :param perm: list with permutation, for example `[1, 4, 3, 5, 2]`
    :return: number corresponding to the Lehmer Code (`15` for input provided above)
